# fakedrawerinbrno

This is a simple Go terminal implementation of the game "A fake artist goes to New York".
I created this for me and my friends and also as to try creating my first github project and just to mess around.

## TODO

- gui interface for adding words so I can give it to my friends
- making the gui an easy to launch app


## JSON file format

The file includes one list of json objects with two keys: "category" and "text". The category is what is shown to all players, while text is shown to all but the fake.

This is an example of the correct format of the json file: `[{"category":"Games", "text":"Bang!"}, {"category":"Games", "text":"A Fake Artist Goes To New York"}]`

Have fun! :D
